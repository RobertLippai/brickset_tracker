# Sample Database
The sample.db has been pre-loaded with data, so you don't need to set up your own database.
It has some brick brands and sets added and a user with an editor role. 
The example sets are sourced from [Rebrickable's Free LEGO Catalog Database](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/).

## Tech
- Python + Flask + SQLAlchemy
- PostgreSQL (SQLite fallback)
- HTML with Jinja2 templates
- Bootstrap5 with the [Freelancer theme](https://github.com/startbootstrap/startbootstrap-freelancer)
- RESTful API (Flask-RESTful)

## Setup
1. Clone this repo
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RobertLippai/brickset_tracker.git
    cd brickset-tracker
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment & install dependencies:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Configure environment variables
- Copy the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
- Fill in the variables inside .env file.

- If youâ€™re using PostgreSQL, make sure your DB is set up and the URI is correct.
If no SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI is provided, the app will automatically use a local SQLite database!

4. Run the app
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

## To Do
- Add searching by tags
- Add proper input validation and visible error messages for forms
- Redesign editor page
- Create editor page for adding tags
- Replace Flask-Login with JWT
- Create a standalone frontend

> ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:** Transform the app into a proper REST API backend by using JWT and moving all frontend logic to a separate app.
